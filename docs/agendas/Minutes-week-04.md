	TA ANNOUNCEMENTS

Knockout criteria week 2 doesn’t count. Failing to meet the knockout criteria for week 3 doesn’t mean failing the course. Make sure you have at least 7 merge request approvals in the end. Make sure you have the correct e-mail. Buddy check this week, make sure to do it properly, take in mind the rubric. HCI assignment coming up soon. Pay attention to deadlines. TA’s will grade tasks and planning. Also use estimated time commands and spent time commands. Check the rubric for questions. Put last meetings minute takers notes in gitlab. Write tests in the same merge request.

	PROBLEM WITH MERGE REQUESTS
Don’t forget to approve the merge requests. If not, the merge doesn’t count as your contribution.

	This week's agenda.

No one except Mete did the frontend. Changing backend and frontend programmers so people do both sides. For the backend some controller classes are missing. They have to be implemented. Dependency injections will be fixed. After the controllers are done, we can start working on functionalities. Data propagation should be looked up on. Everyone should take a look at other classes made by others to understand the totality of the project. For admins we can just have a button in the homepage that is “Sign in as an admin”. Andac will do basic transactions. IBAN attribute might not be needed. Add issues to gitlab. Interact with each other if any question about their code arises. Use comments, try to be pickier about the code, try to find small issues that might be a problem in the near future and talk about them with others.
