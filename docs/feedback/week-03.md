# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There was a chair and a minute taker. 

#### Agenda

Mark: Good

Feedback: The agenda was added on time. It followed the template. It is very readable and self-explanatory. 


#### Performance of the _Previous_ Minute Taker

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: After a meeting you should take sometime to refactor the notes and make them more readable.
Ideally, the notes should be clearly understood by someone who did not attend the meeting. 
You do have tasks assigned to people, but the tasks are not concrete.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Sufficient/Good

Feedback: You were mostly in charge.

To further improve: Start the meeting on time. You should engage other members by asking: "What do you think about this idea?" 

#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good/Very good

Feedback: The team did take the ownership of the meeting. Most of the members were involved in the discussions.
Atmosphere was constructive. Everyone seemed to listen and everyone's ideas were taken into account.

To further improve you could: Engage everyone in the discussion even more. I would like some team members to speak up more :)


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: 

Each week you should present changes from last week. Maybe make it an agenda point?

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: Each week, each member should briefly mention what they worked on. Maybe make it an agenda point?
