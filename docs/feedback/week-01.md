## Formative Assessment

#### 1) Self-organization

Grade: Insufficient

This weak the team was not in charge. However, most of the team-mates engaged in discussions and participated. The tone was respectful. I am looking forward to seeing how you will conduct your own meeting!


#### 2) Suggested Topics

Grade: Insufficient

All suggested topics were covered, but the TA was the main person moderating the meeting. TIP: Take a look at the team work lecture in order to understand what is expected from you.
