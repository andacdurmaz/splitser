# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There was a chair and a minute taker.

#### Agenda

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The agenda was added to the repository on time.
It followed the template. However, you could make it more readable and have a clearer structure. Consider using indentention, headings, and etc.
Also, feel free to provide a sentence of explanation for some meeting points, so that the team can easily figure out what they will be discussing.

#### Performance of the _Previous_ Minute Taker

Mark: NOT APPLICABLE FOR THIS WEEK

Feedback: In general make sure that the meeting notes are merged to GitLab,
that the notes are clear, include a section on a tak distribution and agreements discussed
in the meeting, make sure agreements are realistic.

#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The chair ensured all points are covered in an appropriate amount of time. 
I liked how the chair would ask: "Any questions?" after concluding agenda points. 
To further improve, you can encourage your team members to speak up during discussions.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: The team did take the ownership of the meeting. Atmosphere was positive.
Everyone's ideas and comments were taken into account. I would like everyone from your group to speak up during the meeting.
So even if you are more on the introverted side, please put effort to voice your opinions.
Additionally, the rest of the group (especially the chair) can motivate the members to speak up.
For example, "Hey, X what values should we add to the Code of Conduct?".

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficient ? Not that applicable for this week.

Feedback: Ideally, I want you to present what you have worked on in the previous week.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: That's good that you kept in mind the task distribution. 
Good that you discussed tasks from last week like CoC and Git Assignment. 
Good that you also talked about future tasks. Each week I would like you to present what each one of you worked on in the previous week. Currently, it seems like all of you are putting in the effort :)
