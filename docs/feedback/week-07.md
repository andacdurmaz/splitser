# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There was a chair and a minute taker.

#### Agenda

Mark: Good

Feedback: The agenda was added to the repository on time.
It followed the template.
For the agenda points, for each of them decide if it is an inform/discussion/decision-making point.
Also, feel free to provide a sentence of explanation for some meeting points.

#### Performance of the _Previous_ Minute Taker

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The tasks are not clearly assigned to people. It is a bit difficult to read, and some bullet points are not discriptive enough like: "User
Andac has a dept class almost done.".

#### Chair performance

Mark: Sufficient/Good

Feedback: You followed agenda. Introduced and wrapped up the agenda points. You could further work on that to be more in charge. You could also try engaing others in discussions more.

#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good/Very good

Feedback: The atmosphere was constructive. The team took ownership of the meeting. Everyone's ideas were taken into account.
You could encourage each other to speak up more.

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Good

Feedback: The changes that were presented were merged to main. There is more work to be done, so make sure to try to put extra effort to get it done soon. But progress is visible.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: I can't really tell based on your discussion if you are splitting work equally. It would be nice if you could reflect each week on how the tasks were distributed and such.
