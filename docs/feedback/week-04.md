# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There was a chair and a minute taker.

#### Agenda

Mark: Good

Feedback: The agenda was added to the repository on time.
It followed the template.
For the agenda points, for each of them decide if it is an inform/discussion/decision-making point.
Also, feel free to provide a sentence of explanation for some meeting points.


#### Performance of the _Previous_ Minute Taker

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: The notes were not merged to main on time, and they don't contain any agreements. Please update them for the next weeks.
Also, stick to the naming conventions. 

#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: All topics were covered. 

To improve: You could wrap up discussion points by asking "Does anyone have anything else to add?".
You could also encourage others to participate more. You were not prepared to smoothly show the Shippable Product.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: The atmosphere was constructive. The team took ownership of the meeting. Everyone's ideas were taken into account.
You could encourage each other to speak up more. 


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: Make sure that all presented changes are on main. Prepare for the presentation beforehand. Maybe specify who should be responsible for presenting the changes in the agenda.
I don't want to see changes in code, but actually running application with front-end working. 

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Good

Feedback: Good that you had a point on the agenda to discuss this. The contribution seems somewhat equal. 
For the future reflect on what did well, how much time you spent on your tasks and what can be improved in terms of distributing issues.
