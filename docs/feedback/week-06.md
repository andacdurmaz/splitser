# Meeting


#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There was a chair and a minute taker.

#### Agenda

Mark: Good

Feedback: The agenda was added to the repository on time.
It followed the template. 
For the agenda points, for each of them decide if it is an inform/discussion/decision-making point.
Also, feel free to provide a sentence of explanation for some meeting points.

#### Performance of the _Previous_ Minute Taker

Mark: Sufficient/Good

Feedback: There was a good amount of notes that were clear.
I would lke you to clearly show which tasks are assigned to what people. Maybe make a use of a table. 

#### Chair performance


Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You covered all the topics and were in charge. You can try including others in discussions more. 

#### Attitude & Relation


Mark: Good/Very good

Feedback: The atmosphere was constructive. The team took ownership of the meeting. Everyone's ideas were taken into account.
You could encourage each other to speak up more.

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficient/Sufficient

Feedback: Have an agenda point to present shippable product.
The way it should work is that one person appointed by a chair, runs the application and shows all the changes. 

Based on the descriptions of what each one of you was working on, I would assume that you are falling behind. 
Make sure to do a lot of coding this week to catch up. 

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: It seems like some members had fewer tasks and work than others. 
I would like to you to maybe discuss something about how much time the tasks took and how to improve for next week.
